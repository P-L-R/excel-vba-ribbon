# Excel VBA Ribbon Customization

This Excel VBA solution was developed to help streamline a reporting process in the accounting department. It adds custom buttons to the ribbon, which enables the user to run custom macros.

The initial exports are out of a system with formatting that isn't easily digestable in the target report. These macros handle the reformatting and restructuring of the invoice data, which enables the accountant to generate summaries that are useful.   

### Extending the Ribbon

The custom buttons can be added via custom UI ribbon editor, or by adding a customUI folder with a customUI.xml to the excel zip directory at the root level. 

### Included Files

Only the relevant files have been included in this repo.

* customUI.xml
* modRibbonControl.bas
* refresh_report.bas
